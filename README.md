# PyArmadillo - linear algebra library for Python

* PyArmadillo is an alternative linear algebra library (matrix maths) for the Python language, with emphasis on ease of use
* Provides high-level syntax and functionality deliberately similar to Matlab
* Provides classes for matrices and cubes
* Integer, floating point and complex numbers are supported
* Relies on [Armadillo](http://arma.sourceforge.net) for the underlying C++ implementation of matrix objects and associated functions,
as well as on [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) for providing the glue between C++ and Python
* Can be used for machine learning,  pattern recognition, computer vision, signal processing, bioinformatics, statistics, finance, etc
